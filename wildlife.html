                        <p class="content-title">Design Workshops on Wildlife Conservation</p>
                        <p class="content-txt">During the Wildlife week of India in October 2013, together with a group of biologist I conducted design workshops centered around wildlife conservation.<br><br>

                        The workshops were divided into three categories: <br></br>
                        1. Observing nature: <br></br>
                        I believe the best way we humans learn is by directly interacting with the living organisms around us. As kids, we often wondered if trees talk between themselves, if birds have languages. There are so many wonders yet to be discovered. Eaglesnest, being one of  the most remote & unexplored corners of the world, makes these wonders readily accessible. It is a place where people are still discovering species of birds, macaques and reptiles that are not found anywhere else  in the world.<br></br>
                        Keeping that in mind, we trekked to remote places where ‘camera trap’ are set to capture endangered animals like clouded leopard, red panda and golden cat. While the kids were immersed in the exploration, we introduced them to technologies that has catapulted biological research to new levels. The children were intrigued by how sensors can help us track these shy animals. <br></br>

                        <img class="content-img" src="img/EWS/6.jpg" alt="">
                        Birdwatching and using a spotting scope to trace birds. The children strolled through the forest watching birds and identified them using bird books.

                        It was especially a brilliant moment when we got the chance to interact with endangered species like “Abor Hills Agama”.

                        2. Ideating or Design Thinking: <br></br>
                        In these workshops the children were given a brief presentation on bio-mimicry and design thinking.  And they were given complete freedom to brainstorm on ideas in every possible pattern or ways they liked. <br></br>
                        Based on their understanding of the biodiversity of Eaglesnest from the week long camping in the forest, they designed concepts for products and services taking inspirations from it. Some of the interesting ideas that came along were:<br></br>
                        _<b>360 degree view glasses</b> inspired by compound eyes of insects,<br></br>
                        _<b>foldable helmet</b> inspired by longhorn beetle <br></br>
                        _<b>Motorbikes that balance on their own</b> using the principle of halteres in that of a crane fly <br></br>
                        _<b>Gecko shoes</b> for climbing walls etc.. (the process is documented in) <br></br>

                        All the design thinking that happened in this session is documented <a href="http://issuu.com/soujanyaaboruah/docs/bio-design_workshop/1"> here.</a> <br></br>

                        3.  Creating: <br></br>
                        These workshops were more fun as the children got themselves to re-imagine the birds they saw and paint them on their t-shirts. There was one session on moth traps, where they studied moths and other invertebrates on the moth screen. Using images of which as a material of art they were allowed to create artworks. A few images of the moth trap session were projected to a blank paper on the wall. Children re-imagined the visual components of the images and created new visual connotations of it by making artworks over the projected image. <br></br>

                        Straw-hat, fighter planes, space crafts as imagined by the children.

                        “moth under spotlight” like the earth with maps and stars & moon.
