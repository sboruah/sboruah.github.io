                <p class="content-title">Chlorophile</p>
                <p class="content-txt"><!--<a href="http://www.chlorophile.io">-->Chlorophile is a collective of designer, evolutionary biologist, computer scientist, permaculturist, shepherd and a bunch of unqiue children who work together to explore worlds both in digital domain and physical environment. It is a collaborative learning environment for interdisciplinary explorations. It was founded by me and Priya Iyer an evolutionary biologist with the vision to nurture the creative confidence of children in underprivileged regions of India by giving them the experience of learning which fosters their ability to create, to reason and grow. We are located in a village called Rakkar, Dharamshala, at the foothills of the Dhauladhar range of the Himalayas.<br><br>
                  <img class="content-img" src="img/CP/kids.jpg" alt="">

                  We implement our vision by supplementing formal school education with informal sessions where we collaborate to pursue topics of common interest, seek to create, express ourselves, make trips, interact with visitors and gain exposure to new perspectives and ways of being.  The topics that we’ve explored so far are design, biology, technology, science, art, poetry, craft and performing arts. We occasionally go for treks where we learn about nature and biodiversity. We also invite guests to share their knowledge and experience. <br><br>

                  It is a space where children immerse themselves in art, technology and design. We are exceptionally enthusiastic about hardware tinkering and learning the language of “talking to computer” by commanding a robot called Finch using Scratch programming tool.

                  At Chlorophile, we are inspired by the diversity of life forms around us in the Himalayan foothills and seek to document this diversity, understand design in nature and create inspired by it.<br><br>

                  Children often go tree climbing and return with fruits and vegetables. They also love to experiment with cooking and document the recipe by illustrating it.

                  We believe in tangible outcome-oriented learning rather than assessment oriented learning. Most of our learning involves creative thinking and deploying the ideas to real life experiments.

                  In leisure hours we sometimes get into the shoes of fictitious characters and try to live their lives. This brought us to try our hands on puppetry and theater arts.
