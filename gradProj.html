                        <p class="content-txt"> Graduation project culminating in May 2012. <br><br>
                           
                        User Centred Design Approach to Education: A study on new media implications on the prevalent system of education, to meet user specific needs. It is focussed on understanding the behavioral model of learning and document the design process involved in developing educational courses for special children. During this project, I worked on the development of a management based educational application for the partially blind and documented the entire process of design involved. The research was conducted in several blind schools around the Delhi including National Association for the Blind and Blind Relief Association, Nizamuddin.This project was born out of my deep interest in learning & epistemology and concern for the under-served community of India. <br><br>

                        The project has been documented in this <a href="http://issuu.com/soujanyaaboruah/docs/user_centered_design_approach_to_ed/1">paper</a>. <br> </br>

                        In Origami, by the logic of folding, every fold you make to an inchoate single plane determines the final structure of the 3D formation. Similarly, every step taken in instructional design process determines the quality of the learning materials. During this project I did a thorough study of the process involved in instructional design and created an infographic representation to explain it. <br><br>
